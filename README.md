Hello, I'm Justin.

I work for a company based in Europe, where I lead a small team of developers working on a web site that serves some 30M users a month.
We mainly use PHP, Rust and React for that, with the infrastructure based on AWS, DynamoDB and Kubernetes.
So my job is to keep everyone busy, help developers improve their skills for our common good, and also do some programming.
I'm not looking for a new job.

I currently live in Yerevan, Armenia.  In my free time I enjoy discovering new places and capture some of them on video, for which I have a [dedicated YouTube channel][1].  Shorted videos and photos go to [Instagram][2].  I used to live in a village, growing trees, building a tourist camp site and a community, but that was in Russia, so we put that to a halt and moved out.

Previously I used to run a blog, an internet radio, organize events for the electro-industrial scene in Saint Peresburg (Russia), but that is long gone.  Currently my interests lie in the area of rural community development and sustainable living.
